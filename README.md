# Battleship Game in Python

## Overview
This Python-based Battleship game is a simple, console-based version of the classic game where players attempt to sink each other's ships by guessing their locations on a grid. This implementation is designed for a single player against the computer, where the computer places ships randomly on a 10x10 grid.

## Features
- **Single-Player Mode**: Play against the computer with randomly placed ships.
- **Simple Console Interface**: Easy-to-use console interface for inputting guesses and seeing game status.
- **Automatic Ship Placement**: Ships are automatically and randomly placed on the grid at the start of the game.
- **Hit or Miss Feedback**: Immediate feedback on whether a guess results in a hit or miss.
- **End-Game Detection**: The game detects when all ships have been sunk and ends the game.
